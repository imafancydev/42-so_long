Welcome to the 42 So_Long project! This project is part of the curriculum at 42 and focuses on creating a 2D game using the MinilibX, a simple graphic library provided by 42. So_Long is a game where the player navigates through a map, collects items, and avoids obstacles to reach the goal.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of the So_Long project is to develop a fully functional game that incorporates various game elements, such as map rendering, player movement, collision detection, item collection, and win/lose conditions. By completing this project, you will enhance your understanding of game development concepts and gain practical experience in using the MinilibX library.

<h2>Features</h2>
Map Rendering
So_Long allows you to load and render game maps stored in a specific format, typically a file with a .ber extension. The map consists of different tiles representing walls, paths, collectible items, the player's starting position, and the exit. The MinilibX library provides functions to render graphical elements on the screen, enabling you to display the map with the appropriate textures and colors.
